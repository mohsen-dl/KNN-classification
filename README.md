# KNN classification

## Who makes $50 000 a year?

#### Introduction
Data classification is the process of categorising data for the most effective and efficient purpose. Machine learning is a set of methods for finding patterns in data and using them to draw conclusions or make predictions. Data classification may be applied to both structured and unstructured data. A set of data is provided as training data in classification. The algorithm receives a collection of input data and related outputs. As a result, the training data set contains both the input data and their class labels. The algorithm creates a model or classifier using the training dataset. The classification model might be a Decision Tree, a KNN, a Neural Network and so on. The test data set is the new data given to the model which is unlabelled and the trained classification model tries to predict the labels and correct category. In this work, Decision Tree, KNN and Neural Network will be used as classification methods and their results will be evaluated and compared to each other.

### Project Description
The k-nearest neighbours' algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a 
non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to 
make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual 
data point. We implemented KNN classifier in this project.

#### Datasets
A dataset is a collection of raw data which should typically be preprocessed before being used by analytical and mining methods. Data preprocessing is a critical task in the data mining process that involves modifying or removing data before using it to assure or improve performance. For this work, the “Adult Data Set” is selected from UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether annual income exceeds $50K. Barry Becker extracted the data from the 1994 Census database. The prediction can be useful to find which indicators and attributes are affecting people’s annual income.
